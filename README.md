The most current version of this code exists in the May 5 Folder.

To run, download the entire folder and open and run the Run_This_File.py file. This will pop-up a window to select between 3 days or 5, 10, or 20 years.

The program takes 1-3 minutes to run depending on length of simulation. The output is four plots that are saved to the folder the files are in. They show power output, temperature, and concentration throughout the simulation as well as a solubiltiy vs temperature plot and a diagram of pressures in the system.
